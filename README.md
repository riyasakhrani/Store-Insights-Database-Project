# Store-Insights-Database-Project
This project conducts sales and inventory analysis of a fictional coffee shop using SQL. The dataset was found on Kaggle and provides sales and inventory data for the month of April. This project aims to showcase my knowledge and understanding of SQL by performing queries that output key data for the store owner and employees. The database will allow the owner/employees to retrieve data to answer business-related queries. For example, they can use data from sales receipts, pastry inventory, and sales targets to calculate the stores' performance and optimize inventory levels. With the help of this database, the owner can see how to allocate resources better and make informed business decisions. Some of the queries that are used answer the following questions:

  1. What is the sales revenue?
  2. Which store has the highest sales?
  3. What are the top-selling products (in terms of quantity sold and revenue)?
  4. Which store met its monthly sales target?
  5. What pastries have the highest wastage?
  6. What is the profit margin per unit for each product?
